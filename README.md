# BMI calculator

<h1 align="center"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iSsiqXqqL.png"/></h1>

This project aims to create a compact BMI calculator using HTML and React. The BMI calculator displays if you are overweight, obese, underweight or in the right weight depending on your height (calculated on metres) and your weight (calculated on Kilograms).

- Please, be aware that many key factors are not calculated in a BMI test, such as muscular mass and bone density as well as other factors, therefore do not take this test very serious. This was meant only to be a project.

My took inspiration in the BMI calculator from Dinil Thilakarathne.
